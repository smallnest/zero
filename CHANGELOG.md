# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) once the first release is
tagged. Until then, source builds report the version `dev`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `SECURITY.md` with a private vulnerability-reporting path, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, this changelog, and
  GitHub issue/PR templates.
- `--theme {auto|dark|light}` flag for the TUI (previously only the `ZERO_THEME` env var existed).
- "Accessibility / Appearance" section in the README documenting `NO_COLOR`, `ZERO_THEME`, `/theme`,
  and `ZERO_NO_FADE`.

### Changed
- Provider connectivity health checks now allow loopback hosts for explicitly user-configured local
  providers (Ollama / LM Studio), so the keyless local-model path verifies instead of failing with
  "localhost hosts are blocked". The SSRF guard for fetched/remote URLs is unchanged.
- Auth (401/403) errors now show a curated, actionable message pointing at `zero auth` / setup; the
  raw upstream body is shown only under a verbose/debug flag.
- No-provider / missing-key errors now point at `zero setup` and `zero auth`, and distinguish a
  missing key from a rejected key.
- `zero doctor` no longer reports "Overall: pass" when no provider credential is configured, and
  formats the missing-language-server list for humans (no raw Go `map[...]`).
- Raised the `faint`/`faintest` theme tokens (and the light-theme accent) to meet WCAG AA contrast for
  the content they carry.
- `NO_COLOR` is now honored for any non-empty value, per the no-color.org spec.

### Removed
- The inert `/input-style` slash command (it had no backend).

### Fixed
- README/`go.mod` Go-version mismatch and other stale docs claims surfaced by the product/UX audit
  (`docs/audit/2026-06-21-product-ux-audit.md`).
