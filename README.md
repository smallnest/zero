Zero is an AI coding agent for your local terminal. It can inspect a repository,
edit files, run commands, use browser/terminal helpers, and keep durable local
sessions while you choose the model and the permission level.

```bash
zero
zero exec "fix the failing test in ./pkg"
zero exec --output-format stream-json < turns.jsonl
```

## Why Zero

- **Use the model you want.** Bring OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, OpenRouter,
  DeepSeek, Mistral, xAI, Qwen, Kimi, GitHub Models, Ollama, LM Studio, or any
  OpenAI-/Anthropic-compatible endpoint.
- **Stay in control.** File writes, shell commands, network access, and
  out-of-workspace writes go through Zero's permission and sandbox policy.
- **Works in the terminal.** The TUI has model/provider pickers, image input,
  slash commands, live plan/tool rendering, scrollback, themes, and resume/fork
  support.
- **Works without the TUI.** `zero exec` is scriptable, supports text/JSON/
  stream-JSON I/O, isolated worktrees, spec-first runs, and meaningful exit
  codes for CI.
- **Keeps context local.** Sessions are stored on disk, searchable, resumable,
  and never uploaded as telemetry by Zero.
- **Extensible when you need it.** Use MCP servers, skills, plugins, hooks, and
  specialist subagents from the same CLI.

## Install

### npm

```bash
npm install -g @gitlawb/zero
zero
```

The npm package installs a small wrapper plus the matching Zero binary for your
platform from GitHub Releases. It supports Linux, macOS, and Windows on x64 and
arm64.

### Bun

Bun does not run dependency lifecycle scripts by default, so the `postinstall`
that fetches the Zero binary is skipped and the first run fails with
`No native binary found next to the npm wrapper`.

The simplest fix is to trust the package after installing, which runs the
blocked postinstall. This works for project and global installs:

```bash
# project install
bun add @gitlawb/zero
bun pm trust @gitlawb/zero

# global install
bun add -g @gitlawb/zero
bun pm -g trust @gitlawb/zero
```

Alternatives: allow the postinstall up front by adding
`"trustedDependencies": ["@gitlawb/zero"]` to your project's package.json
before `bun add`, or run the installer manually
(`node node_modules/@gitlawb/zero/scripts/postinstall.mjs`) on Bun versions
that do not have `bun pm trust`.

### Install scripts

Linux/macOS:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gitlawb/zero/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gitlawb/zero/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

### From source

Source builds require Go 1.25+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gitlawb/zero.git
cd zero
go run ./cmd/zero
```

Release installers and the npm wrapper require published GitHub Release assets.
If you are testing before the first public release, build from source:

```bash
go build -o zero ./cmd/zero
```

On Linux, build the sandbox helper too if you want native sandboxing:

```bash
go build -o zero-linux-sandbox ./cmd/zero-linux-sandbox
go build -o zero-seccomp ./cmd/zero-seccomp   # optional compatibility wrapper
```

Put `zero` and `zero-linux-sandbox` in the same directory on `PATH`
(`~/.local/bin` is a good default). macOS does not need an extra helper binary.
Windows source builds can use the main `zero.exe` as their sandbox helper; release
archives still ship standalone Windows helper executables.

More install details: [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md).

## First Run

Start the TUI:

```bash
zero
```

The setup wizard helps you pick a provider and model. You can also configure
providers from the command line:

```bash
zero setup
zero providers list
zero models list
zero doctor
```

For API providers, set the matching environment variable before setup or enter
the key in the wizard:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...
export LONGCAT_API_KEY=...
```

To configure Meituan LongCat (LongCat-2.0) directly, run:

```bash
zero providers setup longcat --set-active
```

For local models, run Ollama or LM Studio and then use `zero setup` or
`zero providers detect`.

## Daily Use

### Interactive TUI

```bash
zero
```

Useful controls:

| Control | Action |
|---|---|
| `Enter` | send the prompt |
| `/` | open slash-command suggestions |
| `Shift+Tab` | cycle permission mode |
| `Ctrl+B` | show/hide the sidebar |
| `Ctrl+C` | cancel or exit |

Common slash commands:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/model`, `/provider` | switch the active model/provider |
| `/spec`, `/plan` | draft and review a plan before building |
| `/image` | attach an image for vision-capable models |
| `/resume`, `/rewind` | continue or roll back local sessions |
| `/compact`, `/context` | manage context usage |
| `/permissions`, `/tools` | inspect available tools and policy |
| `/add-dir` | allow an extra write directory for this session |
| `/theme`, `/doctor`, `/config` | adjust appearance and inspect setup |

### Headless `exec`

```bash
zero exec "explain internal/agent/loop.go"
zero exec --model claude-sonnet-4.5 "refactor the config loader"
zero exec --use-spec "add rate limiting to the API client"
zero exec --worktree "try the migration in an isolated worktree"
zero exec --resume
zero exec --fork <session-id> "try the other approach"
```

Programmatic use:

```bash
zero exec --input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json < turns.jsonl
```

The stream-JSON contract is documented in
[docs/STREAM_JSON_PROTOCOL.md](docs/STREAM_JSON_PROTOCOL.md).

## Safety Model

Zero is designed to make side effects visible.

- Workspace reads are allowed by default.
- File writes are limited to the workspace unless you grant another directory.
- Shell commands, network access, destructive commands, and elevated actions are
  permission-gated.
- `--add-dir <path>` and `/add-dir <path>` grant additional write roots without
  giving the agent the whole filesystem.
- Unsafe/autonomous modes are explicit opt-ins.
- Secrets are redacted from tool output and logs where Zero controls the surface.

Example:

```bash
zero --add-dir ../docs-site
zero exec --add-dir ../shared "update both repos"
```

Sandbox behavior can be inspected with:

```bash
zero sandbox policy
zero sandbox grants list
```

## Web And Local Control

Zero includes local file/search/edit/shell tools, `web_fetch` for public URLs,
and MCP support for additional tools.

For local dev servers, use shell commands such as `curl` through `exec_command`
so the normal sandbox and permission policy applies. Long-running commands stay
attached to a background terminal session and can be listed or stopped from the
TUI.

The npm package also includes browser and terminal helper packages used by local
browser/terminal tools. Source builds can use the same helpers when they are on
`PATH` or configured in Zero's local-control settings.

## Extending Zero

### Project and personal instructions

Zero appends project-specific guidance to the system prompt from the first
`AGENTS.md`, `ZERO.md`, or `.zero/AGENTS.md` file found in each directory from
the git root down to your current working directory (checked in that order
per directory). Files are injected general-to-specific, capped at 8 KiB per
file and 32 KiB total.

A personal `ZERO.md` under `config.UserConfigDir()/zero/ZERO.md`
(`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zero/ZERO.md` or `~/.config/zero/ZERO.md` on Linux/macOS,
`%AppData%\Roaming\zero\ZERO.md` on Windows) applies across every workspace, ahead of any project guidelines.

### Plugins

Plugins are discovered from `~/.config/zero/plugins/<name>/plugin.json` (user
scope — `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `~/.config` on every OS, independent of the
`config.UserConfigDir()` path used above) and `<cwd>/.zero/plugins/<name>/plugin.json`
(project scope — resolved from the current working directory, not the repo
root), and managed with `zero plugins`. A manifest can declare:

- `tools` — custom tools (`command`, `args`, `inputSchema`, and a
  `permission` of `prompt` or `deny`; `allow` is honored only when manifest tool
  auto-approval is enabled)
- `hooks` — commands run on `beforeTool`, `afterTool`, `sessionStart`, or
  `sessionEnd`
- `prompts` and `skills` — additional prompt/skill files

MCP servers (`zero mcp`) and standalone markdown skills (`zero skills`) use
the same extension points and can also be wired up outside of a plugin
manifest.

## Appearance And Accessibility

| Control | Effect |
|---|---|
| `NO_COLOR=<anything>` | disables color output |
| `ZERO_THEME=<name>` | selects the startup theme (`auto`, `dark`, `light`, or a color theme like `dracula`, `nord`, `gruvbox`, `tokyo-night`, `catppuccin`, `one-dark`, `solarized-dark`, `rose-pine`, `everforest`, `solarized-light`) |
| `--theme <name>` | selects the TUI theme from the CLI (same names) |
| `/theme` | opens the theme picker inside the TUI (live preview; `/theme <name>` switches directly) |
| `ZERO_NO_FADE=1` | disables streaming fade animation |

Meaning does not rely on color alone; diffs, permissions, and statuses also use
text or glyph markers.

## Development
