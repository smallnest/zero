// Transient-failure retry, shared by every provider.
//
// SendWithRetry centralizes one retry policy so all providers behave consistently
// (previously only the OpenAI provider retried; Anthropic and Gemini surfaced the
// first failure).
//
// What is retried: ONLY 429 (rate limit) and 503 (service unavailable) — the
// statuses where the server explicitly did NOT accept the request, so replaying
// it cannot duplicate work. Other 5xx (500/502/504) and transport/network errors
// are NOT retried: a completion POST is non-idempotent and may have reached and
// been processed by the server, so replaying it could duplicate
// (billable) work. Only the INITIAL request is ever in scope; once the response
// body starts streaming it is never re-issued.

const defaultMaxRetryAttempts = 6

// maxBackoff caps a single backoff wait so a hostile or buggy Retry-After can't
// stall the agent for minutes.
const maxBackoff = 30 * time.Second

// retryBackoffBase is the first wait when the server supplied no Retry-After.
// Rate-limit windows are measured in seconds, not milliseconds: retrying a 429
// after 400ms almost always burns the attempt while still limited, so the
// schedule is 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, then maxBackoff. A var so tests can shrink it.
var retryBackoffBase = 2 * time.Second

// SendWithRetry issues an HTTP request, retrying ONLY the safe-to-replay server
// responses (429 and 503, see ShouldRetryStatus) up to maxAttempts — backing off
// between tries and honoring a server Retry-After header and context
// cancellation. Other 5xx and transport/network errors are returned immediately,
// never replayed (see the package note). The request is rebuilt from body each
// attempt; setHeader (if non-nil) sets headers on every attempt.
//
// It returns the final *http.Response (which the caller inspects for a non-2xx
// status, exactly as before) or an error for a network failure / context
// cancellation. Retries exhausted on a retryable status return that response,
// not an error, so the caller's existing HTTP-error path still runs.
