# npm Wrapper Smoke Checklist

Run this checklist when a PR changes npm distribution files such as
`package.json`, `bun.lock`, `bin/zero.ts`, `scripts/npm-wrapper.ts`, build scripts,
package release scripts, or the npm `bin` wrapper.

## Required Checks

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run build
bun run smoke:build
```

`build` and `build:go` both compile the Go-native release binary and inject the
version from `package.json`. Keep the Bun install/test checks because the npm
wrapper and release scripts still ship from this package.

Also run the Go checks when the PR changes Go entrypoint, CLI, or release
artifact behavior:

```bash
bun run test:go
bun run build:go
bun run smoke:go
```

## Checklist

- `package.json` has the expected package name, version, and `bin.zero` entry.
- `bun install --frozen-lockfile` succeeds without lockfile changes.
- The wrapper binary resolves through the package `bin` entry and
  `node_modules/.bin` in a package-install smoke test.
- The built binary exits 0 for `zero --version` or `zero --help`.
- `zero --version` reports `zero <package.json version>`.
- Release packaging still emits the expected archive and checksum names when
  package release files change.
